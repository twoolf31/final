  <h2>What's a Personal Pronoun?</h2>

    <p class="intro">A personal pronoun is a short word that replaces a noun and refers to a specific person(s) or thing(s). They are typically used to avoid redundancy that occurs when using one noun repetitively, as well as safe space--especially when that noun is incredibly long. Can you imagine reading a biography on Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff Sr. without any personal pronouns? Yikes!</p>

    <p>Personal pronouns are essential to the way we communicate with one another, and using someone's personal pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment. It's just the same as how using a person's name can be a way to respect them. And "just as it can be offensive or even harassing to make up a nickname for someone and call them that nickname against their will, it can be offensive or harassing to guess at someone's pronouns and refer to them using those pronouns if that is not how that person wants to be known" (<a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why" target="_blank">My Pronouns</a>).</p>

  <h2>The Big Three</h2>
  
    <p class="intro">There are three sets of personal pronouns (and variants on them) that you'll come across quite often: <strong>she/her, he/him,</strong> and <strong>they/them</strong>. The first two are gendered, while the last set is gender-neutral, which typically means that individuals using those pronouns do not see themselves as strictly male or female. They might be two, none, all, or some other combination of pronouns (he/they, he/she/they, they/she, etc.). It is never rude to ask; only rude to assume!</p>

	<h3>Extra, Extra: More Neopronouns</h3>

    <p class="intro">Every identity is valid, and a person's pronouns are theirs to chooseâ€”no matter how strange they may seem to you. Because while any pronouns other than he/him, she/her, and they/them are considered neopronouns, there are far more possibilities out there than you could even imagine. There are animal-type ones like pup/pups/pupself or bun/buns/bunself; there are tech-type ones like bot/bots/botself or droid/droids/droidself; and there are even spooky-type ones like voi/void/voidself or gho/ghos/ghostself. In the end, it doesn't matter what someone chooses as their pronouns because it's their choice and ours to respect.</p>
